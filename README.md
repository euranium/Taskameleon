A backbone.js and jQuery based todo application. The todo MVC part is based on the [todoMVC][]. Information is stored as JSON strings in local storage. No passwords are stored for security reasons. Users emails and names are stored only in local storage, and are never sent to any database. The application is hosted on [my site][]. I chose to use local storage instead of cookes and sesion storage because of the I don't like cookies (but I do love real cookies), there is no backend and cookies are for servers remembring users. I also wanted persistant storage over multiple repeat uses. There is very little information stored so it should not make much of a memory footprint.
